# ServicePool
Resource Pool for Services



Hi There,

This project creates a basic resource pool that eagerly aquires the max amount of resources allowed on construction by the caller.
Future enhancements include "Lazy and Eager Aquisition Pattern", and "Leasing and Evictor Patterns". I'll probably provide some 
sort of configuration interface for those in the initialization call.

Thanks and God Bless You :=)
